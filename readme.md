## TODO

- [x] [DONE] The HTML page shows a form with three input options - Top Text, Bottom Text, Image - and a submit button 
- [x] [DONE] Users should be able to submit a form on the page to generate a new meme on the page
- [x] [DONE] They should be able to add **multiple memes** to the page by submitting the form multiple times
- [x] [DONE] Users should be able to click on a button to delete/remove a meme from the page
- [x] [DONE] The form boxes should clear out automatically after the submit is clicked
- [x] [DONE] The form fields need to have validation so they will not submit if a field is missing
- [x] [DONE] Be sure to style your meme generator! It should be functional but also look nice
- [x] [DONE] **Only use vanilla JavaScript: no frameworks/third-party libraries are allowed**
